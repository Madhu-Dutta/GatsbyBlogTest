Natural Family Photography is a husband and wife team; Ross – internationally awarded photographer/creative, and Rochelle – multi-skilled photographic producer/designer. We are specialists in the art of photographing people and in the design, production and display of quality finished art.
As a couple, our earliest work was devoted predominantly to commercial clients; providing imagery to support iconic brands and publications both locally and abroad. While this work continues, Natural Family Photography was launched to meet increasing demand from the general public for our unique style and approach through portrait, family and wedding photography. Since then, families and couples across Melbourne and beyond have entrusted us with their most important moments; stories we continue to tell over time through continuing relationships with our clients, and culminating in beautiful art that transforms interior spaces.
We now enjoy a wonderful family of our own, with five amazing young children. Our clients value our first-hand understanding of the challenges and rewards of family life and Ross’ renowned ability to help his subjects feel completely comfortable and at ease.
